# Results and Discussion

We found the optimized `alpha` value of our Ridge model be
`r best_alpha`. In doing so, we were able to achieve a cross validation
score of `r best_score_cv`.

```{r hyperparameter_tuning, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Hyperparameter Tuning for Ridge", out.width = '60%'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("result/tuning_ridge.png")
```

Our prediction model performed decently well on the test data as well.
The testing score we obtained with the testing set is `r test_score`.
Below graph shows the plot of the predicted weight (lbs) vs actual
weight (lbs) from the testing data set.

## Critique, Limitations and Future Improvements

We faced several limitations in our analysis such as limited types of features
available for feature engineering and modelling. In addition, many features had 
to be discarded due to their lack of relevance to our model.

Future studies on this subject can be improved with the inclusion of more relevant
predictive features, such as using the seed/genetic data of the father and mother,
and more data. Additionally, further data cleaning methods could
also be applied, such as inspection and removal of outliers, as these can affect 
regression model performance significantly.

We were able to create a more accurate model with Random Forest to
predict weights of giant pumpkins but have opted to use the Ridge model
instead. We have chosen to do so as the Random Forest model required
upwards of 5 hours to run which we believe to be impractical and as such
have decided to use a slightly less accurate but a much faster model. Thus,
in the future, it could be worth looking into using alternative regression
models that may provide accurate and timely results.
