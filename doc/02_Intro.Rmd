# Introduction

The data set used in this project is originally from [GPwebsite](http://www.bigpumpkins.com/Default.asp). The Great Pumpkin Commonwealth's (GPC) mission promotes the hobby of cultivating giant pumpkins throughout the world through standards and regulations to ensure quality of fruit, fairness of competition, recognition of achievement, fellowship and education for all participating growers and weigh-off sites. (Read more [here](https://gpc1.org/ "GPC website") and [here](http://www.bigpumpkins.com/ "Data on giant pumpkins from bigpumkins.com")).


In 1979, a Nova Scotia farmer named Howard Dill happened to grow a particularly large pumpkin. He decided to bring it to a fair near Philadelphia that was holding a weigh-off, his 438.5-pound vegetable won first place. This brief summary brings us to our prediction question to determine if we are able to predict pumpkin weights for the following year.

Giant pumpkin growing is a surprisingly competitive hobby as the right seeds can command huge prices. There is even a prize pool of
$30,000 if you break the world record (1,226 kg). Everyone dreams of a spot in "the Super Bowl of pumpkin weigh-offs."

So let's test a model to estimate whether within the next year farmers can break the record or not.

Base on the data gathered by bigpumpkins website, the ott (over the top) is the most important feature for estimating the weight which is shown in below picture.
