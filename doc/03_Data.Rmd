## Summary of raw data

-   There are a total of about 28000 observations out of which about 15000 observations are of the type 'P' pertaining to Giant Pumpkins variety which is our subject of interest here.

-   The raw data is of char type and needs to be converted suitably into numeric and character types for feature preparation.

-   Some cleaning and preprocessing will be required for columns like `id` (separation of year and type), which contains information to be used in the prediction model.
